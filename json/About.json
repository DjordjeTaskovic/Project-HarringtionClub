"text":"Membership is the same even from the founding by election people after the proposers,who have known the candidate for other recognizable clubs (at least two or more),and formally nominate the person for membership. The election is by a special committee (itself elected),which may interview the candidate and which looks at any support and also objections of other members. Some top clubs still maintain distinctions of this matter which are often undefined and rarely explained to those who do not satisfy their membership requirements."
